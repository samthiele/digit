## 3D geological modelling with neural fields

-----

Geological modelling is the construction of a spatial (usually 3D) model of the subsurface. They have diverse applications, from exploration to geotechnical and hydrogeological modelling. Most importantly for DigIT, 3D structural models form the foundation for geometallurgical deposit models and, through their description of ore geometry and structural context, are often applied to identify near-mine exploration targets. 

Classical modelling workflows require extensive and time-consuming data preparation, interpretation and parameter choice, which makes rapid model updates and changes difficult.

Using deep-learning-based methods (neural fields; e.g. [Hillier et al., 2023](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/16/6987/2023/)), we develop fast digital approaches that can represent complex geological structures and integrate diverse input data in the models. This yields realistic and flexible geological models for efficient exploration. 

In line with our open-science policy, these developments will be integrated into the open-source Python package [curlew](https://github.com/samthiele/curlew/).
