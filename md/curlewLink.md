## 3D geological modelling with neural fields

-----

Traditional geological modeling workflows require extensive data curation, interpretation, and parameter selection, which can prevent rapid updates and changes.

We are building a new approach based on emerging **deep learning-based modeling methods**, or neural fields (e.g. Hillier et al., 2023). These approaches can learn complex geological structures and integrate diverse input data to potentially enable more realistic and flexible geological models. These developments will be included in the open-source [curlew](https://github.com/samthiele/curlew/) python package.
