## Demonstration area 1: Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge)

-----

The **Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge)** span the border between Germany and the Czech Republic and host numerous greisen and skarn deposits with tin, lithium and tungsten. Several deposits are in an advanced exploration stage.

For DigIT, the Ore Mountains are important as the location of several readily accessible historic mines, where the technologies developed in the project can be tested and demonstrated.
