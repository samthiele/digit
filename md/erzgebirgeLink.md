## Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains)

-----

The **Ore Mountains** (Erzgebirge) straddle the border between Germany and Czechia, and host many Sn–(Li)–W-rich greisen and skarn deposits. Several of these are under advanced stage exploration.

Most importantly for DigIT, the Erzgebirge provides several easily accessible historic mines for testing and demonstrating the technology we are developing.
