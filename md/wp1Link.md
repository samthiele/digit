## Work package 1: Mapping mine faces with digital outcrops and hyperspectral imaging

-----

In work package 1 we develop reliable and objective mapping methods for open-pit and underground mining areas, by combining digital 3D outcrops produced by photogrammetry and LiDAR with hyperspectral image data. The aim is to rapid capture rich geological information from mine faces in historic and modern mines, to allow the creation of rich digital archives.

**Technical objectives**

This workpackage aims to develop and demonstrate procedures for the:

- acquisition and processing of short-wave infrared (HSI) data in underground mining.

- processing of long-wave infrared (HSI) data in open-pit mining.

- mapping of mineralogy and mechanical properties across mine walls 

- delivery of preliminary results within one hour of data acquisition.
