## Work package 1: Mapping of mining areas with digital outcrops and HSI

-----

In WP-1, we develop reliable and objective mapping tools for surface and undergound mining areas, integrating 3D digital outcrops from photogrammetry and LiDAR with hyperspectral imaging data to rapidly capture valuable geological information.

**Objectives**

- Demonstrated workflow for the acquisition and processing of shortwave-infrared HSI data from underground mines.
- Demonstrated workflow for the acquisition and processing of longwave-infrared HSI data from surface mines.
- Capability to map mineralogy and mechanical properties across mine-faces within ~1 hour of hyperspectral data acquisition.
