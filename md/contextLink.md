## Context and societal need

-----

DigIT addresses several barriers to European mineral exploration, including societal acceptance, data-integration and digitisation. Mines are hugely data-rich environments, as the mining processes progressively unearths valuable geological information, but limited sampling and mapping of exposed mine faces means that much of this information is lost. 

Digit thus aims to develop the technology to rapidly and accurately capture geological information exposed during mining (or in historic mines), and leverage it to supercharge near-mine exploration. Crucially, we have identified near-mine exploration as key to responsible metal supply, as discoveries near active and historic mines enable sustained development and tend to be easier to valorise in a socially and environmentally acceptable way.

## Funding 

The DigIT project is funded by the German Ministry of Research, Technology and Space (BMFTR), as part of a call for "New approaches to the exploration, extraction, and processing of primary raw materials in the context of national and European cooperation" (EGARoh).
