[LiquidEarth](https://www.terranigma-solutions.com/liquidearth) is Terranigma Solutions’ (TER) software for visualizing geological 3D information and models. Interactive and immersive visualization is key to interacting with complex geological models and datasets, and gaining understanding about their relation to larger-scale structure and context.

Through DigIT, [LiquidEarth](https://www.terranigma-solutions.com/liquidearth) is being expanded to enable the **visualization of hyperspectral mapping data**, including 3D hyperspectral point clouds. Tools for rapidly constructing and updating 3D geological models will also be integrated to enable rapid interpretation, extraction of accurate structural measurements and seamless integration with geotechnical or geometallurgical models.
