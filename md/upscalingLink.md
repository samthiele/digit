## Mechanical and mineralogical upscaling

-----

Hyperspectral data is influenced by physical properties like grain size, porosity, and density, which can in turn determine fluid flow and geometallurgical behaviour. DigIT aims to demonstrate that several **mining-relevant properties** (e.g. density, strength, grindability) can be reliably (albeit empirically) predicted using hyperspectral imaging tools.

Our preliminary work (e.g. [Kamath et al., 2025](https://se.copernicus.org/articles/16/351/2025/); [Thiele et al., 2025](https://se.copernicus.org/articles/16/1249/2025/)) has demonstrated this potential. The next step is to upscale this technology to allow applications to mine-face mapping.
