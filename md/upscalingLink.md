## Mechanical and mineralogical upscaling

-----

Hyperspectral measurements are strongly influenced by both mineralogy and physical rock properties like grain size, porosity and density. These properties in turn have a major impact on mining and processing. DigIT aims to show that many **mining-relevant properties**, including strength and comminution behaviour, can be estimated reliably — albeit empirically — from hyperspectral imaging.

Prior work (e.g. [Kamath et al., 2025](https://se.copernicus.org/articles/16/351/2025/); [Thiele et al., 2025](https://se.copernicus.org/articles/16/1249/2025/)) has demonstrated this potential. The next step is to upscale the methodology and demonstrate its application to mine-face mapping.
