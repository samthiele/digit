## Work package 2: Simulation of ore-forming processes using physico-chemical models

-----

Numerical reactive transport models are powerful tools to gain new insight into ore-forming processes and so predict near-mine exploration targets. However, they are often difficult to validate against real observational data. 

DigIT is developing a workflow that uses detailed hyperspectral data from the mine-face to calibrate chemical reaction simulations and identify key controlling parameters on ore-formation. This information is then used at a larger scale to derive conceptual exploration indicators.

**Technical objectives**

- Develop chemical models for ore-forming processes and identify key controlling factors and parameters.

- Couple chemical simulations with large-scale flow models to improve process understanding of ore formation.

- Apply the models and simulations at the demonstration sites to derive conceptual exploration targets.
