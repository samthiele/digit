## Work package 2: Simulation of ore formation processes


-----

Numerical reactive transport models provide powerful tools for understanding ore-forming processes, but can be difficult to "anchor" in reality. DigIT will develop a workflow for using detailed observations from the mine-face to constrain chemical reaction simulations and identify key controlling factors. This information will then be applied at larger scale to derive conceptual exploration targets.

**Objectives**

- Development of chemical models for ore-forming processes and identification of key controlling factors and parameters.
- Integration of chemical simulations with large-scale fluid-flow models to gain process understanding about ore-formation.
- Application to help derive conceptual or predictive exploration targets.
