## Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB)

-----

The **Iberian Pyrite Belt** is world famous for volcanic-hosted massive sulphide deposits. These have been known for centuries, and several deposits are currently mined for copper using both open-pit and underground techniques.

Together with the Ore Mountains, the Iberian Pyrite Belt will be used to demonstrate new techniques for the digitization of exposed mine faces in historical and active mines.
