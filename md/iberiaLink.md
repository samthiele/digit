## Demonstration area 2: Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB)

-----

The **Iberian Pyrite Belt** is well known worldwide for volcanic-hosted massive sulphide mineralisation. Several deposits are currently mined for copper in open-pit and underground operations.

Together with the Ore Mountains, the Iberian Pyrite Belt serves to demonstrate new methods for digitalisation of exposed mine walls in historic and active mines.
