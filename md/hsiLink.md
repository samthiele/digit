## Hyperspectral imaging (HSI)

-----

**Hyperspectral imaging (HSI)** offers new ways to analyse materials with high precision, and is already used widely in mining and exploration. Current limitations are (1) demanding data-acquisition procedures, (2) lengthy and complex processing workflows, and (3) a lack of established methods and sensors for underground use (where the sun cannot be used as a light source).

To address these challenges, DigIT is developing and testing new real-time processing methods for hyperspectral mapping in the **VSWIR** (visible to short-wave infrared) and **LWIR** (long-wave infrared) wavelength ranges. These new and optimised approches will be demonstrated in both open-pit and underground mines.
