## Hyperspectral imaging (HSI)

-----

**Hyperspectral imaging (HSI)** has a wide range of applications in the mining and exploration industry. However, uptake is currently limited by (1) complicated data acquisition procedures, (2) long processing times (3) a lack of established procedures for underground environments and long-wave infrared (LWIR) sensors, and (4) complex analysis workflows.

DigIT aims to address many of these limitations, by developing and demonstrating realtime processing workflows for **VSWIR** (visible, shortwave infrared) and **LWIR** (long-wave infrared) hyperspectral mapping of surface and underground mining areas.
