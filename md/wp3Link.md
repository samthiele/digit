## Work package 3: Self-updating common-earth models

-----

Work package 3 develops self-updating common-earth models: geological 3D models that integrate geophysical, geological and petrophysical data into a unified understanding of the subsurface. These models can incorporate new datasets quickly and efficiently to update regional or deposit-scale exploration and mining models, using LiquidEarth and Python workflows that are being developed during the project.

**Technical objectives**

- Procedures for building self-updating geological models.

- Verification and demonstration of graph-database based standardisation for exploration data.

- Engagement with industry and other partners through conferences, trade fairs and direct outreach.
