## Work package 3: Updatable common earth models and data management


-----

WP-3 develops self-updating geological models that integrate new data quickly for production and mine-proximal exploration. Data are standardized and Python workflows will automate model updates using GemPy and emerging neural-field approaches.

**Objectives**

- Workflow for creating self-updating geological models.
- Verification and demonstration of data standardisation for  exploration data.
- Engagement with industry and other stakeholders through conferences, trade fairs, and web presence.
