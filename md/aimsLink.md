## Project aims

-----

The BMFTR-funded project DigIT focuses on developing novel digital technologies for non-invasive, mine-proximal exploration. The DigIT team pursues four main goals:

1. **Safe, objective mapping of mining areas** — by integrating digital outcrops and hyperspectral imaging to capture geologically relevant information during mining and in historic workings.
2. **Self-updating geological models** — that can incorporate new information quickly into exploration models.
3. **Simulation of ore-forming processes** — using physico-chemical reactive-transport simulations for process understanding and to derive exploration targets.
4. **Improved integration of geological data** — through new tools for interoperability, long-term availability and reusability of mine-mapping data.

The developed technology will be tested in two study areas: the tin-rich [Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge)](./#studySitesSnap/Erzgebirge) (Germany) and the copper-rich [Iberian Pyrite Belt](./#studySitesSnap/Iberia) (Spain).
