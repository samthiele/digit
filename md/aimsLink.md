## Aims and Goals

-----

DigIT aims enable non-invasive, mine-proximal exploration, through the development of digital technologies for:

1. **Safe, objective mapping of mining areas** — integrating digital outcrops and hyperspectral imaging to capture valuable geological information during mining.
2. **Self-updating geological models** — that quickly integrate new data into exploration models.
3. **Simulation of ore formation processes** — using physical-chemical models to gain process understanding and so develop exploration targets.
4. **Improved data integration** — through tools that enable the interoperability, longevity and reusability of mine mapping data.

These developments will be demonstrated in two study areas: the Sn-(Li)-W-rich [Ore Mountains](./#studySitesSnap/Erzgebirge) (Germany) and the Cu-rich [Iberian Pyrite Belt](./#studySitesSnap/Iberia) (Spain).
