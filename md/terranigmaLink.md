## About us

-----

DigIT is a collaboration between the [Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology](https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pOid=32948&pNid=2423&pLang=en) as part of [Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf](https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pOid=74004&pNid=0&pLang=en) and [Terranigma Solutions GmbH](https://www.terranigma-solutions.com/).

The **Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology (HIF)** has long-standing experience in hyperspectral mapping, the development of digital tools for exploration, hyperspectral upscaling of geometallurgical properties, and deep-learning-based 3D modelling.

**Terranigma Solutions GmbH (TER)** is a spin-off from [RWTH Aachen](https://www.cg3.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~qoyf/cg3/). The start-up specialises in 3D data visualisation and geological modelling of deposits. 

Within DigIT, Terranigma is extending its software [LiquidEarth](https://www.terranigma-solutions.com/liquidearth) to enable immersive digital mapping of mine walls and seamless integration of the resulting mapping data for real-time updates of 3D mining and exploration models.
