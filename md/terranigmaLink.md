## About us

-----

DigIT is a collaboration between the [Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology](https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pOid=32948&pNid=2423&pLang=en), part of the [Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf](https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pOid=74004&pNid=0&pLang=en), and [Terranigma Solutions GmbH](https://www.terranigma-solutions.com/).

The **Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology (HIF)** brings extensive experience in hyperspectral mapping, and is developing acquistion and processing workflows for (1) LWIR hyperspectral mine-face scanning, (2) hyperspectral upscaling for 3D mapping of geometallurgical properties, and (3) coupling deep-learning based 3D models with mineral systems understanding and numerical simulations to identify near-mine exploration targets.

**Terranigma Solutions GmbH (TER)** is a spin-off company from [RWTH Aachen](https://www.cg3.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~qoyf/cg3/) and specialises in 3D data visualization, cloud connectivity and geological modelling. In DigIT, it is extending the [LiquidEarth](https://www.terranigma-solutions.com/liquidearth) software to enable immersive digital mine mapping and seamless integration of mine-face mapping data to update 3D mine and exploration models in realtime.
