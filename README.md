## Context

-----

Data integration and digitalisation are two major challenges for mineral exploration in Europe. Mining is a traditionally data-intensive industry with complex information flows: exploration and mining companies must continuously generate and process geological information from the subsurface. 

During mining, important new information is often unearthed and exposed on pit walls and underground mine faces. However, time constraints and current technology limits the amount of data that can be feasibly extracted from these valuable exposures before they are removed during the mining process.

DigIT aims to develop digital technologies to capture such geological information and data from historic mining quickly and precisely, and to make them usable for deposit-scale exploration. Efficient near-mine exploration is in turn a key to domestic metal supply: finding new mineral occurrences near active or closed mines allows long-term reuse of existing mining sites. In many cases this is more sustainable and socially acceptable than developing entirely new mining districts, and it supports public acceptance of mining projects—for example by reusing local expertise, workforce and infrastructure and maximising resource use at existing sites.

## Funding

-----

DigIT is funded by the Federal Ministry for Research, Technology and Space (BMFTR) from 1 January 2026 under the call “New approaches to exploration, extraction and processing of primary raw materials in the context of national and European cooperation” (EGARoh). The project runs for 3 years.
